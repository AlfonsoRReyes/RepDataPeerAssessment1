## Convert column to row names
`intervals` has the first column as the day of the observation and that makes the data frame uneven from the point of view of the intervals; they should be 288 but with the date they add up to 289.

```{r}
library(RepDataPeerAssessment1)

data(intervals)
intervals
```

```{r}
intervals.only <- intervals[, -1]
rownames(intervals.only) <- intervals[, 1]
intervals.only
```

```{r}
# save the intervals data frame where the date is set up as rownames
save(intervals.only, file=paste(project.data, "intervals.only.rda", sep = "/"))
```
